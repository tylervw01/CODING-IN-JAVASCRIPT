      <h1>Data types and type conversions</h1>
      <p>
        Programs are intended to process data. No matter if it is a web shop
        application, a human resources management system, or a computer game,
        each of these programs reads, processes and stores huge amounts of data.
        In the previous chapter, we already learned how to declare, initiate,
        and modify the variables that allow these data to be stored in the
        context of a running program. While discussing variables, the concept of
        data types appeared, and it turned out that the JavaScript language is
        weakly typed, so among other things it allows you to change the type of
        data stored in one variable.
      </p>

      <p>
        We can divide the data according to their properties. For example, you
        will certainly intuitively distinguish between numeric data and text
        data. Such classification is of course arbitrary. Numbers can be further
        divided into, for example, integer numbers and real numbers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Distinguishing data by their types is one of the characteristic features
        of any programming language. Each type of data is connected with certain
        operations we can perform on it. Usually, there are also methods of
        converting data between selected types (e.g. a number can be converted
        so that it is saved as a string).
      </p>

      <p>
        In JavaScript, data types are divided into primitive (or simple) and
        complex (or composite). Among the primitive types, we can find numbers
        and strings of characters, while the complex types include, for example,
        arrays and objects.
      </p>

      <p>
        The difference between these data types is contained quite precisely in
        their names. The primitive types, well, are simply not complex. If you
        write a data of a primitive type into a variable, one particular value
        will be stored there. This value will be atomic, in other words, it will
        not be possible to extract components from it. Data of complex types,
        such as an array, will consist of many elements of primitive (not
        complex) types.
      </p>

      <p>Thus, we will logically deal with primitive types first.</p>

      <p>
        Before we move on to discussing data types, we need to introduce one
        more new concept: literals.
      </p>
      <p></p>

      <p>
        Literals are a way of noting specific values (data) in the program code.
        Literals are found in virtually all programming languages, including
        JavaScript. We used literals in the previous chapter when initializing
        variables.
      </p>

      <h3>Let's take a look at an example:</h3>
      <pre><code>
let year = 1990;
console.log(year); // -> 1990
console.log(1991); // -> 1991
console.log("Alice"); // -> Alice
</code></pre>

      <p>
        In this example, we declare the variable year and immediately initiate
        it with the value 1990. The digits 1990, written in the code at the
        place of variable initialization, are a literal that represents a
        number. The value 1990 is displayed on the console using the year
        variable. Then we display on the console the value 1991 and "Alice", in
        both cases using literals (representing a number and a string
        respectively). In JavaScript, almost each data type has its own literal.
      </p>

      <h1>DATA TYPES - PRIMITIVE - STRING</h1>
      <p>
        A very convenient mechanism that was introduced to JavaScript in 2015 is
        string interpolation. It allows you to treat a character string as a
        template, in which you can place values in selected places, such as
        those taken from variables. Such a literal is created using backticks
        (or grave accents) instead of quotation marks. The places where values
        are inserted are marked with curly brackets preceded by a $ sign.
      </p>

      <pre>     
    <code>let country = "Malawi";
let continent = "Africa";
 
let sentence = `${country} is located in ${continent}.`;
console.log(sentence); // -> Malawi is located in Africa.
        </code>
        </pre>
