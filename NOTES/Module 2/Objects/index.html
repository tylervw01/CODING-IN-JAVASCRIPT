      <h1>The Length Property</h1>
      <h2>Methods vs. Property</h2>
      <p>
        Quite recently we introduced the concepts of method and property. They
        appeared when we were talking about the String type. These were
        functions and values related to a specific object. Now it turns out that
        an array is implemented as an object in JavaScript, so it probably also
        has its methods and properties. And indeed it does. There are many very
        useful methods that help us to work with arrays, such as combining
        arrays, cutting out elements, sorting, or filtering. We will only look
        at some of them now, because many others require us to be able to create
        our own functions. We will come back to some of them in the section
        dedicated to functions. length The length property is used to get
        information about the length (the number of elements) of the array
        (including empty positions between existing elements).

        <code>
let names  = ["Olivia", "Emma", "Mateo", "Samuel"];
console.log(names.length); // -> 4

names[5] = "Amelia";
console.log(names.length); // -> 6

console.log(names); // -> ["Olivia", "Emma", "Mateo", 
//"Samuel", undefined, "Amelia"]
console.log(names[3]); // -> Samuel
console.log(names[4]); // -> undefined
console.log(names[5]); // -> Amelia
