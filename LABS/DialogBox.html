      <h1>DIALOG BOX</h1>
      <p>
        Let's go back to our contact list. After some recent tweaks (i.e. using
        an array and objects) it is actually starting to look like a list.
        However, one quite serious problem remained. Changing data in the list,
        such as adding a new contact, has to be provided for right away in the
        program code. What if we want to give the user the ability to enter the
        data of the added contact while the program is running? Modify the
        program to add, at the end of the list, not the contact, which is given
        in the code, but the one which the user will give during the program
        run. Use the prompt method to do this. At the end, display the first and
        the last contact from the list.
