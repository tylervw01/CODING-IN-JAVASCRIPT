      <h1>TASK: Arrays(Library Of Books)</h1>
      <p>
        We are setting up a small library of books about JavaScript programming.
        We have three books, and we want to prepare a list of them. We will
        store three pieces of information about each book: the title, the
        aurthor, and the number of pages:
      </p>

      <p>1. Speaking JavaScript, Axel Rauschmayer, 460;</p>
      <p>2. Programming JavaScript Applications, Eric Elliot, 254;</p>
      <p>3. Understanding ECMAScript 6, Nicholas C. Zakas, 352.</p>

      <br />

      <p>
        - Create an array of three objects representing the books. Each object
        must have the following properties: title, author, pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        - We've added a new book to our collection: Learning JavaScript Design
        Patterns, by Addy Osmani, 254 pages. Use the appropiat method to do
        this, which will attach the book th the end of the array. Display the
        length of the array and, in turn, all the book names in the collection.
      </p>
      <p>
        - Use the slice command to copy the last two books to the new array.
      </p>
      <p>
        - The first book from the collection is lost in unexplained
        circumstances. You have already accepted the loss, so now remove it from
        the array. Which method will you use for this purpose? Display the
        length of the array and all the names of the books from the collection
        in turn.
      </p>
      <p>
        - Display the sum of the pages of all the books from the collection.
