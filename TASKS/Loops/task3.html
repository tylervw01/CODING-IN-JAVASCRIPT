        <p>There are ten different numbers in this numbers array.</p>
        <p>Write a program that first writes out all these numbers on the console, then only those that are even(hint: the remainder of dividing an even number by 2 is equal to 0), then only those that are larger than 10 and at the same time smaller than 60.</p>
