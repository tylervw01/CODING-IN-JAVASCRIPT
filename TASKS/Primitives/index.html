      <h2>PRIMITIVES</h2>

     <p>Write a piece of code that will create variables and initialize them with
      values of Boolean, Number, BigInt, String and undefined types using
      (whenever possible) literals and constructor functions. Print all values
      and all types of those values using console.log. Try to use string
      interpolation to display the value and type at the same time with a single
      console.log call, for example, in the following form: 1000 [number]. Carry
      out a chain of conversions: create a Boolean from a BigInt created from a
      Number that was created from a String. Start with the value "1234". Is it
      possible? Try adding two values of the same type and check the result
      type. Try it for all primitive types. Try adding two values of different
      types and check the results. Try to modify the line const str1 = 42 + "1";
      to get the result 43 (without removing the quotes around 1).</p>
